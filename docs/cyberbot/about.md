### How to setup a welcome channel!


1. Add `{welcome}` to the channel topic to make it a welcome channel. This will have it send the default message to that channel everytime someone joins your server
2. If you want to have a custom message add `{message:YOUR MESSAGE HERE}`
3. If you want to mention the member add `<mention>` inside the message where you want the mention to be. 
4. If you want it to be an embed add `{embed}` to have it mention the member do `{embed:Mention}`

example
```js
{welcome} {embed:Mention} {message:Welcome, <mention>! Enjoy your stay!}
```
